This repository contains scripts.js and tiers.xml used in safari.

*** Installation instructions ***

The scripts as shown are not for 3rd anyone's use. We do not allow guests to use them.
As we have solely recreated safari code. If we find these terms and conditions are breached.
We will therefore take full ungiven action against those who breach. Are denied use.

Forking the repo is not recommended as these scripts contain hardcoded configuration parameters
only suitable for the server we are running.

*** Guidelines for contributors ***

DON'T USE THE TAB CHARACTER. The scripts use 4 spaces and the mix of tab and spaces is what
causes the formatting issues at times.
You can set Notepad++ to use 4 spaces when the tab key is hit though if you use that to edit.
Settings->Preferences->Tab Settings
Set it to "Tab Size: 4" and tick the "Replace by space" box

Using jshint for checking some coding style is not recommended.
In particular, following practices are frowned upon:
- tab character when indenting (see above)
- trailing whitespace
- undefined variables (always use var in the outermost scope for that variable)
